## **_Description_**

#### This website is designed for physical therapy students that are learning musculoskeletal anatomy for school. My website will have a login/sign up page and a home page describing the wesbite. There will be a page listing all of the flashcards to choose from and study and another page that allows the user to select body regions if they want to focus their studies in that direction. When a specific card is selected, the user will see details about the muscle, including the origin, insertion, innervation, and muscle action. In other words, the muscle's OINA. Authentication and authorization will allow logged in user's to select specific muscle's to add to their collection to allow for more targeted study. There will be three models, in addition to the user model, one each for a flashcard, a user's collection, and one for grouping muscles by body region. Full CRUD operations will be available on the flashcards, as users will be able to create, read, update, and delete flashcards as they need for their classes.
