## **_Description_**

#### This website is designed for physical therapy students that are learning musculoskeletal anatomy for school. They are able to create flashcards and add as much detail as they need to study for their classes. There are input spaces for each muscle's origin, insertion, innervation,action and an image of the muscle can be uploaded as well. Students can leave comments and memorable study tips as well to further improve their studies. Additionally, separate flashcards are separated by body region, to match up with the different units students learn as they go through their anatomy course. Authorization and authentication is implemented through Auth0, and students are only able to create and study flashcards if they are signed up and logged in. There are three models, a flashcard model, a comments/post model, and a body region model with full CRUD on the flashcard model.
