      <p>
        My name is James Aubrey and I am a former physical therapist. During PT
        school, we had to learn a great deal about anatomy. This website is
        designed to help current PT students memorize their OINAs, or origin,
        insertion, innervation, and action, for each muscle they need to learn
        for shcool.{' '}
